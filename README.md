QuickSort and MergeSort Algorithms



# What I Learned
In my CPSC 320 Algorithms class we have been working with the Divide and Conquer Algorithms Quicksort and Mergesort.
Within this project, we were required to read input in from a text file that contained 1,024 numbers in a randow assorted
order.

#Steps Within Program
1.) Read Numbers in from Text File
2.) Part I - 
  1.) Ran Quicksort on Unsorted Array
  2.) Ran Quicksort on Sorted Array
  3.) Ran Quicksort On Reversed Order of Array
3.) Part II - 
  1.) Ran Merge Sort on Unsorted Array
  2.) Ran Merge Sort on Sorted Array
  3.) Ran Merge Sort on Reversed Order Of Array
4.) Part II - 
  1.) Create a method to sorted an array of strings using the Quicksort and Partition logic
  2.) Sort array of strings alphabetically using the Compareto Built in method.
